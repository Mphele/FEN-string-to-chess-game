# Chess Move Validator

This is a command-line Python project that parses a FEN string to display a chess board, allows users to move pieces, and validates pawn and rook moves for both black and white.

Features:
- Visual board with Unicode chess pieces
- Highlighted movement
- Pawn and rook move validation

Future plans: Add other piece logic and castling.
